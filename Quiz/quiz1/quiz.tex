\textbf{Q:} What is the purpose of a final one eye bounce Monte Carlo final gathering of a radiosity solution?

\textbf{A:} To wash away (smooth out) the artifacts appear in the radiosity solution due to using mesh. 
\newline


\textbf{Q:} What is the purpose of a final one eye bounce Monte Carlo final gathering of a diffuse photon map?

\textbf{A:}
To compute the remaining of indirection illumination (after computing direct illumination, specular reflection and caustics).
\newline

\textbf{Q:} How are the set of point sources for instant radiosity determined?

\textbf{A:} The point sources are placed at the locations where a number of simulated photon trajectories hit the surface of objects. 
\newline

\textbf{Q:} What is the meaning of the phase function for volume scattering?

\textbf{A:} The phase function $p(z,\Psi \leftrightarrow \Theta)$ at $z$ describes the probability of scattering from direction $\Psi$ into $\Theta$ and usually depends on the angle between the two directions $\Psi$ and $\Theta$.
